# Three-Bullets-A-Shattered-World
The official GitHub repository for Three Bullets: A Shattered World, an alternate history mod for Hearts of Iron IV. The name of Three Bullets is a reference to three historical assassination attempts, now changed: the deaths of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, Rasputin and the royal family of Russia in 1914, and the survival of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, 1914.
