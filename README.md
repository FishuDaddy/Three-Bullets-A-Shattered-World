# Three-Bullets-A-Shattered-World
The official GitHub repository for Three Bullets: A Shattered World, an alternate history mod for Hearts of Iron IV. The name of 
Three Bullets is a reference to three historical assassination attempts, now changed: the deaths of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, 
Rasputin and the royal family of Russia in 1914, and the survival of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, 1914.

In order to make sure the encoding, file name, and file extension of all files in the mod are usable by game, copy a base game file 
and edit it on your computer. Only after some progress has been made should it be uploaded to this repository.
